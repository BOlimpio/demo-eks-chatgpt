# Demo EKS ChatGPT
I created this project to test chatGPT's capabilities in accelerating development and learning.

Demo EKS ChatGPT is a project that demonstrates how to build and deploy a Python application to an Amazon EKS cluster and monitor it with Prometheus and Grafana. The application uses Flask and SQLAlchemy to implement a simple RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have the following tools installed on your local machine:

+ Terraform
+ Docker
+ kubectl
+ awscli

You'll also need to have an AWS account and an IAM user with the necessary permissions to create EKS clusters, IAM roles, and other resources.

## Building and Deploying the Application
To build and deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/BOlimpio/demo-eks-chatgpt.git
cd demo-eks-chatgpt
```
